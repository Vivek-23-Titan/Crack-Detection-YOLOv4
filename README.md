# Crack-Detection-YOLOv4
Completed a computer vision assignment based on localizing and classifying different types of damage on vehicles windshield. YOLOv4 has been employed for balancing fast object detection as well as accurate damage classification.
# Dataset
The entire dataset consists of 3 different types of damages: crack, bullseye, and scratch. For training the YOLOv4 model, the dataset was divided into a 75:25 ratio i.e., 43 images in training data and remaining 14 images in the test dataset.
